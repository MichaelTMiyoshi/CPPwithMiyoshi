# Documents

There are a few documents that I use in my class for both beginning and advanced programming students.  The documents are in this folder and their descriptions are given in the table below.

Document | Description
-------- | -----------
AppOrGameDesignDocument.docx | A design document that tells the reader the plans for the programmer's game.
AppOrGameEvaluationDocument.docx | The evaluation document used in my class to tell me how well the program designer met the requirements he or she set out for the game.
