If you are reading my book, you will want to clone your first Visual Studio project.  It is similar to the variables and constants file found in the book, but slightly different.

I am using Visual Studio Community 2019.  The nice thing about that Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is that you can just do the cloning when you running the IDE.  When you open the VS 2019, you will see the clone option right there.  Some people have lamented the old start screen, but if you are cloning projects from repositories, you will probably like it.  It is the first choice.
