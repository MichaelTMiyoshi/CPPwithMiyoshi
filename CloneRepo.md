# Clone a Repo with Visual Studio

Here are some instructions (with screen captures) of how to clone a GitHub repo with Visual Studio (2019).  The screen shots and descriptions will help you navigate the process.  Especially, if you have never created a project from a repo before.  (By the way, cloning a repo just means creating a project from a repo.)

The easiest thing to do is start Visual Studio.  (This is true of many other IDEs as well.)  Visual Studio 2019 starts with a screen that has Clone a repo as its first option.  Click on that button (circled in the image).

You will come to a screen where Visual Studio is asking you for the URL or Repository location and local path (to your local repo location).  The local path is most likely already filled in with the location where you save your repos.  Or rather with the location where Visual Studio thinks you should place them.  (You can change this in some setting, but that is beyond the scope of this page.)

Open a browser to the internet and go to the repo you want to clone.  (If you are reading this, then that is most likely what I call the <a href="https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/CPPwithMiyoshi-01VarsAndConsts" target="_blank">first repo</a> to clone.  I have found that you can either click the clone repo button and then the button that copies the repo name onto your clipboard or you can just copy the URL from your browser and paste that in the Repository location field.  Either method works fine.
