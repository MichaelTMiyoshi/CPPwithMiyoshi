# Pair Programming

Pair programming is a unique exercise in programming and team building.  It is a way to put two pairs of eyes and two sets of hands on a program as it is being created.  This might seem impossible at first, but it works out well when done correctly.

When pair programming, one person has control of the keyboard.  The other person looks on and catches errors and helps with the algorithm (again, an algorithm is the specific solution to the problem) development.  Then, the pair switches roles.  The other person controls the keyboard while the one person looks on and helps debug on the fly.  It works out well in both learning and production environments.  People often see errors or ways to improve the code when they are not typing.

While it is good to work with the same pair, it is also good to swap partners every once in a while.  You can swap partners inside and outside your teams when you are pair programming.
