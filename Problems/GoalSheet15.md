# Goal Sheet 15

Goal Sheets 14 and 15 are doing the Game Engine Tutorial.  Fork the repo of [Williams Game Engine](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/WilliamsGameEngineVS2019) to your own GitHub repository, clone it to your local computer, then work through the tutorial.  I allot 2 goal sheets for the tutorial (4 weeks of class) because students do not get to sit down and work through it non-stop in class.  Some choose to do so outside class, but I do not expect that.  I have found that those who can sit down and just go straight through can finish the tutorial in much less time than I allot.  I then have them make their own games from the same game engine.

Have fun with the tutorial.  The part numbers and titles are from the tutorial.  Each part of the tutorial has the student accomplish a specific task.  My students work through each section and demonstrate their progress for their points on the goal sheets.

** Part 6: Shooting the Meteors **

Collision detection.

** Part 7: Animation! **

Make the meteor explode.  Simple animation.

** Part 8: Sound Effects **

Add sound effects to your collisions.

** Part 9: Keeping Score **

Adding points when you destroy meteors.

** Part 10: Endings **

Show the user the score and choice to start over.

** Extra: Create a Scrolling Background **

The Extra in the title is just the title.  It does not mean extra credit for my students.  Creating a scrolling background adds another dimension to the game.
