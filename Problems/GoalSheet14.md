# Goal Sheet 14

Goal Sheets 14 and 15 are doing the Game Engine Tutorial.  Fork the repo of [Williams Game Engine](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/WilliamsGameEngineVS2019) to your own GitHub repository, clone it to your local computer, then work through the tutorial.  I allot 2 goal sheets for the tutorial (4 weeks of class) because students do not get to sit down and work through it non-stop in class.  Some choose to do so outside class, but I do not expect that.  I have found that those who can sit down and just go straight through can finish the tutorial in much less time than I allot.  I then have them make their own games from the same game engine.

Have fun with the tutorial.  The part numbers and titles are from the tutorial.  Each part of the tutorial has the student accomplish a specific task.  My students work through each section and demonstrate their progress for their points on the goal sheets.

**Part 1: Adding a Sprite**

A simple beginning.  Just put a sprite (a picture) on the screen.

**Part 2: Making a Sprite Move**

Add controls and make the sprite move around the screen.

**Part 3: Pew Pew Pew**

Make your spaceship sprite shoot lasers across the screen.

**Part 4: Adding a Meteor**

You need something to shoot.  Add a meteor.

**Part 5: Meteor Shower**

One meteor is not enough for a game.  Create a meteor shower.
