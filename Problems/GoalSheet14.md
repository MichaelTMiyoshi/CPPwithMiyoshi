# Goal Sheet 14 and Goal Sheet 15

Goal Sheets 14 and 15 are doing the Game Engine Tutorial.  Clone the repo of [Williams Game Engine](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/WilliamsGameEngineVS2019) and work through the tutorial.  I allot 2 goal sheets for the tutorial (4 weeks of class) because they do not get to sit down and work through it non-stop in class.  Some choose to do so outside class, but I do not expect that.  I have found that those who can sit down and just go straight through can finish the tutorial in much less time than I allot.  I then have them make their own games from the same game engine.

Have fun with the tutorial.
