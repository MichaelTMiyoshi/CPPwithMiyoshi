# Goal Sheet 01

**Problem GS01-01 (PBJ)**

Write the directions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly (PBJ) sandwich.  (If you are allergic, give the instructions for making a different kind of sandwich.)  Be specific.  You may make some simple assumptions.  For instance, you may assume that the person making the sandwich (not yourself) knows what a knife is.  Other simple assumptions (like where the bread and other ingredients are) can be made as well.  You will be writing this assuming the person has not make a PBJ before.

The grading for this assignment will be done by another student (with possible arbitration by me) following these criteria:

* The instructions are clear and the sandwich can be made without any clarifications from the person giving the instructions (6 points).
* The instructions are pretty clear and the sandwich can be made with 1 to 2 clarifications from the person giving the instructions (5 points).
* The instructions are fairly clear and the sandwich can be made with 3 to 4 clarifications from the person giving the instructions (4 points).
* The instructions are fairly clear and the sandwich can be made with 5 to 6 clarifications from the person giving the instructions (3 points).
* The sandwich cannot be made with the given instructions without more than 6 clarifications from the person giving the instructions (2 point).
* The instructions are turned in, but the sandwich cannot be made with the given instructions (1 point).
* The instructions were not turned in (0 points).

**Problem GS01-02 (decimal to bin, oct, hex)**

Convert 4 decimal numbers (5 or more digits) to binary, octal, and hexadecimal.  You may use the example number 12345 as one of your four.  Do not use numbers too close to 65536, 35768, 16384 if you are using either method.  If you are using the subtraction method, you need to make sure you convert a number with at least 6 subtractions.  Remember that leading zeroes do not count as digits (i.e. 00001 is a single-digit number).  Show all your work when converting from decimal to binary and from binary to octal and hexadecimal.  (Each conversion counts as three points.  Two points for decimal to binary, half point for binary to octal, half point for binary to hex.  Which makes it a double problem, 12 points, for the goal sheet.)

**Problem GS01-03 (Hello World)**

Output “Hello World” to the screen along with at least three other lines.  Make sure you have at least four lines of output.  They must be actual lines, not just wrapped.  (In other words, use the \n to your best advantage.)

**Problem GS01-04 ([RPG](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/CPPwithMiyoshi/blob/master/Problems/RPG_Requirements.md) Instructions) (also counts as project points)**

Create some instructions and introductions for your [RPG](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/CPPwithMiyoshi/blob/master/Problems/RPG_Requirements.md).  Tell the user what is going to happen (or at least, what you intend to happen).  You may not have any way to know how the user will give input yet, but that is okay.  Just give a few introductory remarks and maybe a little back story on the adventure.  You need to also tell who the coder is.  (This counts as both a program for your goal sheet and in the major project section of the grades.)

**Problem GS01-05 (Variables and Constants)**

Write a program that declares, initializes, and outputs variables and constants.  Make sure to label the output.  Your task is to declare 13 variables and 5 constants.  You must have 1 bool, 3 int, 3 char, 3 string, and 3 double variables.  You must use the following constants:
```
const float c = 3.0e8;	// speed of light in meters / second
const float g = 9.8;	// acceleration due to gravity in m/s²
```
You must not use c or g as other names for your constants or variables since they are already going to be used.  The other three constants should be chosen from science.  Constants like Avogadro’s number or Planck’s constant or the Golden Ratio can be used.
