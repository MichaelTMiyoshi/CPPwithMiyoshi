# Goal Sheet 08, Goal Sheet 09, and Goal Sheet 13

Catch up goal sheet.  I use this goal sheet (whichever number) as a time when students can catch up or get ahead as they need.  There are no mustard goal sheets, but as a student of mine once noted, students should relish all goal sheets.  (Thanks Connor.)

The following excerpt explains catch up goal sheets a bit more and has a couple humorous anecdotes.

## Catch Up and Mustard
Excerpt from _[C++ with Miyoshi](https://amzn.to/3bQuePT)_ (I suppose you could call this an ad.)

If you have looked ahead at all, you will see that there is what seems to be a numbering error.  Either that or there is a missing goal sheet.  In other words, the problems from the last chapter are numbered GS04- and the problems from the next chapter (after this one) are numbered GS06-.  So what happened to the GS05 problems?  There are none.  Or at least there are no specific new problems.

I have been teaching computer programming for over twenty years.  During that time, I have figured out the pace the class should go.  I have even tried to change the pace a time or two.  With disastrous results.  This is what happened.

I had a group of students one year who were going at a tremendous pace.  They ended up all finishing their first semester major program around the Christmas break and so we went on to the next subject.  It was great for them.  And I thought, “I must be doing a great job.”

(I am sure this happened shortly after those first five to seven years of teaching.  Those first five years when you are floundering and feeling like a rookie.  Mainly because you are a rookie.  After all, 10,000 hours makes a pro.  So even though I felt like a rookie for about my first seven years, I figured I must have been doing something right to get that particular group of students to such a high level of proficiency.)

Since I figured I was doing such a great job, I thought I ought to be able to change the pace for subsequent groups.  So I did.  That next year was quite the eye opener.  I was not able to keep up the pace for the next group of students and we were not able to successfully get to the same place the last group did.  I had hit a blip in the system.  An outlier.  The group I had that one year was just an anomaly.  So I changed the goal sheets back and keep the pace that I knew worked.

Part of knowing the pace is knowing that not everybody can keep up with the pace.  Even so, I believe every student can learn given enough time.  Unfortunately, there is a time constraint.  The end of each semester.  Still, I know that most students can learn within that time frame.  I just need to make sure they have enough time and attention.

Which brings us back to the goal sheets.

I know that the first semester skills start with output and used to end with functions and the major project.  I also know that there are students who will work faster than the pace I set and students who will work slower than the pace I set.  Which is why I always tell my students to turn in what they have at the goal sheet due dates and add to them as they finish stuff up.  Even if they add stuff after the grace period (2 weeks).  After all, getting some points is better than getting none.

That is great for most of the people, most of the time.  But I have found that I can help those people who are a little slower paced catch up.  And that catch up time is between looping and the next subject.  Which is where this chapter is.

So goal sheet 5 is a catch up goal sheet.  It is a time to catch up and add to those previous goal sheets.  The obvious question is whether there might be mustard goal sheets in the future.  No.  There are no mustard or any other type of condiment goal sheets.  Just catch up ones.  That is the reason the problems are numbered the way they are numbered.  Goal sheet 5 is for catching up.  And if you are ahead of the game, you can always get more ahead.  I will not slow people down.  At least if they are doing things correctly.

By the way, I have one more story to tell.

I am not the most engaging or entertaining lecturer.  I do try to be.  Really.  I just am not the funniest person out there.  Still, I work to infuse a little humor and I tell stories to drive home points.  Every year when we get to this point, I talk about catch up goal sheets.  And every year when I say there are no mustard goal sheets, I must tell my students, “That is where you are supposed to laugh.  Catch up, mustard.  Ketchup, mustard.  You know.  It is supposed to be funny.”  Or some such words.  They usually give me my courtesy laughs.  Okay.  They usually groan at the lame pun, but then they give me the courtesy laughs, and then we go along our merry way.

One year though I was caught off guard.  I said that there were no mustard goal sheets and the students actually laughed.  In earnest.  They even asked if there might be mayonnaise goal sheets.  Well, I did not know what to say or do.  I was flustered.  All those years of telling my students that they were supposed to laugh conditioned me to think that I would always have to do that.  So when they actually laughed, I was caught off guard.  And I told them that.  “I usually need to tell my classes that they are supposed to laugh.  You caught me off guard and I am flustered now.”  Or something like that.  It took me a while to get my composure back, but we finally moved on.  (If I had been as clever as one of the script writers for our local school broadcasts, I would have said that while there were no mustard, mayonnaise, or other condiment goal sheets, I did relish them all.)

At any rate, the goal sheet numbering is not a mistake.  The two week span of goal sheet 5 is for catching up.  And goal sheet 5 is a catch up goal sheets.  And no.  There are still no mustard goal sheets.  And yes, you should relish them all.
