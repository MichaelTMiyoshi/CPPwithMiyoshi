# CPPwithMiyoshi
Companion repo for my book C++ with Miyoshi.

I provide my book, C++ with Miyoshi, to the students in my class, but it is also available online at 
https://amzn.to/3bQuePT  (I suppose you could call this an ad.)

This repo will change and grow and change in time with feedback from my students and readers.

At first, it will have code snippets and a couple Visual Studio projects that people can clone.  Who knows where it will go from there.
