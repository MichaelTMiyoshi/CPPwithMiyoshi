# CPPwithMiyoshi
Companion repo for my book <a href="https://amzn.to/3bQuePT" target="_blank"><i>C++ with Miyoshi</i></a>.

I provide my book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3bQuePT" target="_blank"><i>C++ with Miyoshi</i></a>, to the students in my class, but to those who do not attend my class, it is available online at either of the above links.  (I suppose you could call this an ad.)

This repo will change and grow and change in time with feedback from my students and other readers.

At first, it will have code snippets and a couple Visual Studio projects that people can clone.  Who knows where it will go from there.
